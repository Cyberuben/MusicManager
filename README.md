# MusicManager
MusicManager is a NodeJS based application that allows you to index all your music. Specify a directory containing all your "raw" music files, let MusicManager scan it and you get to decide how to index it. Check songs one by one, automatically search for the suggested ID3 tags using EchoPrint, search for duplicates and save the file when you are ready.

# The name is a working name until I have come up with something better
